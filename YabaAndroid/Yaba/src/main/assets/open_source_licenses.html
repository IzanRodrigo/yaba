<h2>Version 1.6.0</h2>

<p>Release Date: 26/10/2010</p>

<ul>
    <li>Comes with documentation, which is what you are looking at, so you probably know that.</li>
    <li>Added the $this->template->set(); method for
        assigning data with two arguments or a object/array.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed some random bugs with locating layouts, theme partials, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.0</h2>

<p>Release Date: 28/09/2010</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added magical methods __get() and __set() to allow Kohana-style $this->template->foo =
        'bar'; for assigning data.
    </li>
    <li>Added mobile support.</li>
    <li>Third parameter for $this->template->set_partial(); is now an
        optional array/object for data specific to that partial only.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.4.0</h2>

<p>Release Date: 23/07/2010</p>

<ul>
    <li>Removed possibility of duplicate SEO entries, call $this->template->set_metadata('keywords',
        'foo'); twice and it will use the 2nd.
    </li>
    <li>Re-did inject logic, now its just for shoving a hunk of HTML into a partial.</li>
    <li>Fixed $this->template->theme_exists(), it
        was not using slug name so falsely returned true.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.3.0</h2>

<p>Release Date: 24/03/2010</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can now use any extension for your files, not just whatever EXT is set to.</li>
    <li>Updated Template library to add support for getting theme layout lists and checking they
        exist.
    </li>
    <li>Added more options to the default config file.</li>
    <li>Now supports a config file that allows a default theme to be
        set and "Theme locations" to be used. That means you could have application/themes
        as one and third_party/themes as another.
    </li>
</ul>
